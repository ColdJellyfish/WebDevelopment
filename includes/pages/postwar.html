                <h1>Postwar to Present</h1>
                <p>
                    Summarized
                    When people in the West say "post-war era" or "postwar era," they usually mean the time since World War II ended. In a broader sense, a post-war period (or postwar period) is the time right after a war ends. As the war ended in the Philippines, the country took stock of what it had lost. Out of the 18 million Filipinos, more than a million had died or been killed. Most of the major cities, including Manila, were in ruins. As a result of the Japanese occupation, there was a lot of inflation and farms were left empty. Many farm animals also died because of the war. There was damage to factories, transportation, and communication systems. Page 2 | 8 After the war, the Philippine Commonwealth ran into big problems that no one had thought about before the war. In the last few months of the Philippine Commonwealth government, many things had to be taken care of, such as land reform, reopening schools, rebuilding, putting people on trial who were thought to have worked with the Japanese, recognizing and paying veterans, getting the economy going again, bringing back trade, and getting people to invest.

                    1973 Philippine Constitution
                    Draft presented to President Ferdinand Emmanuel Marcos or president Marcos by the 1971 Constitutional Convention on December 1, 1972; deemed ratified by Citizen’s Assemblies held from January 10-15, 1973, proclaimed in force by proclamation President Marcos, January 17, 1973,
                    When martial law was declared, the Constitutional Convention, by virtue of an Act of Congress in 1971, was in the process of drafting a new Constitution. The final draft was adopted by the Convention on November 29, 1972. This was ratified and proclaimed by President Marcos on January 17, 1973 amidst widespread protest and controversy. With the proclamation of a new Constitution, the presidential form of government was changed to a modified parliamentary form. Congress was abolished and was replaced by an elected unicameral National Assembly, known as Batasang Pambansa.
                    The Batasang Pambansa was made up of a maximum of 200 Members elected from different provinces with their component cities, highly urbanized cities, and districts of Metropolitan Manila, appointed representatives from various sectors such as the youth, agricultural and industrial labor sectors, and those chosen by the President from the members of the Cabinet. The Members had a term of six years.
                    
                    Some of the power designated to the president in this constitution is that the president shall be the commander -in-chief of all armed forces of the Philippines and, whenever it becomes necessary, he may call out such armed forces to prevent or suppress lawless violence, invasion, insurrection and rebellion
                    
                    While though its common to remember the bad things especially to the Filipinos, I at least want to remember the good things that service us Filipinos till these days
                    The Philippine heart center, Lung center of the Philippines, National kidney, and transplant institute, these are the pioneering hospitals that was built during that time that save many
                    The cultural center of the Philippines, folk arts theater, Philippine international convention center, the national arts center or Makiling center for the arts, and nayong Pilipino and people’s park in the sky in Tagaytay, cultural heritage and tourism sites during that time
                    To address the influx of people migrating to urban centers from the countryside—which gave birth to a myriad of other problems, such as violence, social unrest, environmental degradation and limited housing provision—President Marcos came up with the Bagong Lipunan Improvement of Sites and Services (BLISS) projects in Manila and in the rural areas to house the country’s poorest of the poor.

                    THE 1986 PROVINSYAL “FREEDOM” CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES
                    WHEREFORE, the New Armed Forces of the Philippines provided support to the Filipino people as they directly exercised their authority to install the new government;
                    WHEREFORE, the courageous action of the populace was carried out in contravention of the 1973 Constitution's amendments;
                    WHEREAS, the immediate mandate of the people, as evidenced by their extraordinary action, calls for a thorough reorganization of the government, the restoration of democracy, the protection of fundamental rights, the restoration of confidence in the entire governmental system, the eradication of graft and corruption, the restoration of peace and order, the maintenance
                    WHEREAS, it must be ensured that the government would uphold fundamental freedoms and human rights during the transition to a new constitution;
                    THEREFORE, I, CORAZON C. AQUINO, President of the Philippines, do hereby publish the following Provisional Constitution in accordance with the powers bestowed in me by the sovereign mandate of the people.

                    he path up to July 4th, 1946, was difficult and dangerous. Since 1565, when the Philippines became a Spanish colony, there have been various uprisings against Spanish control. However, these uprisings were disorganized until the nineteenth century, when nationalism gave rise to a more integrated anti-colonial movement. In 1896, a revolution began as a result of this. A ceasefire was negotiated between the leaders of the Philippines and Spain following intense fighting that reached a standstill.
                    Commodore George Dewey and the US Asiatic Squadron were dispatched to Manila Bay at the start of the Spanish-American War in 1898, where they routed the Spanish Asiatic navy. General Emilio Aguinaldo, who created a revolutionary government, relaunched the Philippine Revolution in earnest. On June 12, 1898, the revolutionary government proclaimed independence, during the peak of its military victories over Spain. In January 1899, the Philippine Republic was legally established in Malolos, Bulacan, with Aguinaldo as president.
                    (Lucillo) American Era
                    Spain gave over its long-standing colony of the Philippines to the United States in the Paris Agreement following its loss in the Spanish-American War of 1898. Just two days before the United States. As soon as the agreement was approved by the Senate, war broke out between American soldiers and Filipino nationalists commanded by Emilio Aguinaldo who wanted independence rather than a new colonial government. Over 4,200 American and over 20,000 Filipino soldiers died in the three-year-long Philippine-American War that followed. Up to 200,000 Filipino citizens perished as a result of war, starvation, and illness.
                    
                    Filipino revolutionaries led by Aguinaldo took control of the majority of the Philippines' main island of Luzon and announced the foundation of the independent Philippine Republic during the post-Spanish-American War acquisition debate in the United States. The first battles between the two sides in 1899 grew into an all-out war as it became apparent that American soldiers intended to impose American colonial sovereignty over the islands. Instead of accepting the Filipinos' claim that they were fighting to repel an outside invasion, Americans preferred to refer to the subsequent combat as a "insurrection."
                    The American-Philippine War had two stages. Aguinaldo's poor attempts to fight a conventional war against the best and equipped American forces dominated the first phase, which lasted from February to November of 1899. The Philippines switched to guerilla warfare during the second phase. It started in November 1899 and continued until Aguinaldo's surrender in 1901 and into the spring of 1902, by which time the majority of the organized Filipino resistance had died down. On July 4, 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt issued a general amnesty and declared the war to be finished, despite the fact that there were occasional, small uprisings and insurrections against American control in the years that followed.

                    Japanese aggression in China prompted much attention to military preparedness. Nearly one-fourth of the national budget was devoted to defense. Gen. Douglas MacArthur, retiring as army chief of staff in Washington, was called by President Quezon to direct plans and preparations. Meanwhile, agrarian unrest festered, and leftist political activity grew. Quezon pushed significant reform legislation through the National Assembly, but implementation was feeble, despite the rapid accumulation of power in his hands.
                    The Japanese attack of the Philippines on December 8, 1941, came at a time when the U.S. military buildup had hardly begun. Their advance was rapid; before Christmas, Manila was declared an “open city,” while Quezon and Osmeña were evacuated to MacArthur’s headquarters on Corregidor Island. Despite a desire, at one point, to return to Manila in order to surrender, Quezon was persuaded to leave the Philippines in March 1942 on a U.S. submarine; he was never to return. Osmeña also went. Filipino and American forces, under Gen. Jonathan M. Wainwright, surrendered in May. An Executive Commission made up of more than 30 members of the old Filipino political elite had been cooperating with Japanese military authorities in Manila since January.

                    The Executive Commission lasted until September 1943, when it was superseded by an “independent Philippine Republic.” The president, chosen by the Japanese, was José Laurel, former associate justice of the commonwealth Supreme Court and the only Filipino to hold an honorary degree from Tokyo Imperial University. More than half of the commonwealth Senate and more than one-third of the House served at one time in the Japanese-sponsored regime. Yet collaboration with Japan was neither as willing nor as widespread as elsewhere in Southeast Asia.

                    Even before the fall of Bataan Peninsula to the Japanese in April 1942, guerrilla units were forming throughout the Philippines. Most were led by middle-class officers and were enthusiastically pro-United States; in central Luzon, however, a major force was the Hukbalahap, which, under communist leadership, capitalized on earlier agrarian unrest. Though in a number of instances collaborators secretly assisted guerrillas, many guerrillas in the hills were bitter against those who appeared to benefit from the occupation. The differences between the two groups became an important factor in early postwar politics.

                    Soon after the U.S. landings on Leyte in October 1944, commanded by MacArthur, civil government was returned to the commonwealth, at least in name. Sergio Osmeña, who had become president in exile on the death of Quezon in August, had few resources to deal with the problems at hand, however. Osmeña’s role was complicated by the fact that MacArthur chose to lionize Manuel A. Roxas, a leading collaborator who had also been in contact with U.S. military intelligence. As president of the Senate, Roxas became, in effect, MacArthur’s candidate for president. Roxas was nominated in January 1946 in a separate convention of the “liberal wing” of the Nacionalista Party, as it was first called. Thus was born the Philippines’ second major political party, the Liberals.

                    Osmeña, though he had the advantages of incumbency, was old and tired and did not fully use the political tools he possessed. In April Roxas was elected by a narrow margin. The following month he was inaugurated as the last chief executive of the commonwealth, and on July 4, 1946, when the Republic of the Philippines was proclaimed, he became its first president.
