                    summarized
An archipelago discovered by Magellan that have a hundred of tribes was deemed as a colony during the sixteenth-century expansion into the east and since then been called Las Islas Filipinas. The Spanish converted most of the population to Catholicism and the religion remains the dominant one in the country. During the later part of 333 years of Spanish rule, nationalist sentiment began grow among group of Indios ( a derogatory term use by the Spaniards to call the Filipinos) fueled in large measure by the writings of national hero Jose Rizal (later executed by the Spanish authorities) and other ilustrados (the Filipino intellegensia)..
History of the Spanish constitution dates back to 1808. Only the constitutions influenced by liberal ideals, among those afterwards in use in Spain, made it as far as the Philippine Islands. The colony did not enjoy the advantages of the Spanish Constitution, save for brief intervals. There was a provision in the fundamental legislation that stated the Philippine Islands would be controlled by special rules, unlike Cuba and Porto Rico, to which certain constitutional rights were later granted. As a result, all of the law governing the Islands began in Spain and was later extended by royal decree in conformity with the Laws of the Indies and the Constitutions.
During the
two brief windows of time (1810–1813 and 1820–1823) when the Spanish
The Constitution was in force in the Philippines. The Philippines had a
representative in the Spanish Cortes between 1834 and 1837. Due to the great
distance between the Philippines and Spain and the difficulty of regularly
appointed delegates arriving in Spain in time for the Cortes sessions, the
Islands were frequently represented by substitutes. The first regularly
selected Philippine delegate was Ventura de los Reyes. The Cortes passed a law
in the latter year by almost unanimous vote in secret session, providing that
Philippine representation in that body should be discontinued. Given the
challenges they faced, the Philippine delegation's efforts did not wholly fail
to produce positive outcomes.
The Philippines did not have a representative in the Cortes after 1837. However,
there were numerous attempts to restore the right. In 1869 and 1890, the Cortes
received amendments granting the Philippines parliamentary representation. The
privilege was favored in the 1872 and 1873 republican draft constitutions.
Through the reviews and the Philippine Association of Madrid's actions, a final
effort was made. 52 petitions from "La Solidaridad" were delivered to
the Cortes asking for the Philippines' parliamentary representation to be
reinstated.
A revolution was launched against Spain and the revolutionaries declared Philippine independence in Kawit, Cavite on June 12, 1898. What became known as the Malolos Congress was convened on September 15, 1898, and the first Philippine Constitution, called the Malolos Constitution, was approved on January 20, 1899, ushering what is called the First Philippine Republic
